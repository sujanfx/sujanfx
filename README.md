### 🧠 About Me  

I'm a backend-focused software engineer who builds **automation tools, agent-style systems, and practical AI integrations** — not just prototypes or notebooks.

I like working at the intersection of:

- Backend engineering  
- Automation & agent workflows  
- Applied cybersecurity thinking  

I care about reliability over hype: **code should run, scale, and survive failure.**

---

### 🚀 What I’m Working On

- Automation-first backend services using **FastAPI / Node.js**
- Agent workflows (Telegram bots, n8n pipelines, LLM tooling)
- Strengthening fundamentals in IAM abuse paths, logging, and secure systems design

### 📌 Featured Projects

> These represent the direction I’m building toward. Older or experimental repos are archived.

| Project | Area | Summary |
|--------|------|---------|
| **AutoPilot-HR** | Backend + Automation | Hiring workflow automation: resume parsing → filtering → notifications → scheduling — structured as a real service. |
| **Value-Prop Agent (XT)** | Agent Systems | Scrapes investor relations content, summarizes, and answers via Telegram bot with usage logging and context memory. |
| **Plant Disease Detection (Refined)** | AI + System Design | ML pipeline with UI, dataset cleanup, explainability — not just a Jupyter file. |
| **TB-Prediction Toolkit** | Applied ML | Reproducible medical ML project with pinned dependencies, explainability (LIME), and responsible handling. |

### 🎯 How I Work

- Code should run with **one command** (or `docker-compose`).  
- Prefer simple, auditable designs over clever, fragile ones.  
- If I repeat a task twice — I **automate** it.  
- Logs > silent failures.  
- Security and failure modes are part of the solution, not an afterthought.
